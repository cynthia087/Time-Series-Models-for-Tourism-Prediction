# Process Overview:

This flowchart outlines a process involving data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

### Start: 
The process begins with an initial dataset.
### Data Preprocessing:
- Signal Processing: The data undergoes some form of signal processing, possibly involving differentiation and smoothing.
- Smoothing: The data is smoothed using a method that combines segmentation and averaging.
### Decision Point:
The processed data is checked to determine if it is smooth and not white noise.
If yes, the process proceeds to model order determination.
If no, the process ends.
### Model Building and Evaluation:
- Model Order Determination: The appropriate order for the model is determined based on the characteristics of the data.
- Model Training: A model is trained using the prepared data.
- Model Evaluation: The performance of the trained model is evaluated.
### End: 
The process concludes with either a successful model or a decision to stop due to data quality issues.
