# Time-Series-Models-for-Tourism-Prediction
This repository presents an in-depth analysis of Thailand's tourism demand from 2019 to 2023 using time series models, including ARIMA, linear trend models, and non-linear trend models. The data used comes from Kaggle’s Thailand Domestic Tourism Statistics dataset.

## Project Overview
We aim to forecast tourism demand in Thailand, focusing on:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and organizing raw tourism data for Bangkok, Chiangmai, and Chonburi.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Utilizing ARIMA, linear, and non-linear models for forecasting.
- **Model Evaluation**: Comparing the performance of different models using RMSE, MAPE, and other metrics.
- **Visualization**: Presenting results with time series plots and decomposition.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis comes from Kaggle and includes monthly tourism statistics for Thailand’s 77 provinces. It contains data from 2019 to February 2023, including hotel occupancy rates, visitor numbers, and tourism revenue.

## Key Data Insights
The data includes:
- **Occupancy Rates**: Monthly hotel occupancy rates across different provinces.
- **Tourism Revenue**: Net profit generated by tourism activities.
- **Visitor Numbers**: Number of local and foreign tourists visiting various provinces.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming**: R for data cleaning, time series analysis, and forecasting.
- **Libraries**: `forecast`, `ggplot2`, `TTR`, and `tseries`.
- **Models**: ARIMA, Linear Trend, Non-linear Trend.

## Repository Structure
- **data/**: Contains the raw dataset (`thailand_tourism_data.csv`).
- **scripts/**: R scripts used for data processing, model building, and visualization.
- **notebooks/**: An interactive Jupyter notebook providing an end-to-end walkthrough of the analysis.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have R and Jupyter installed.
3. Run the R scripts individually for preprocessing, modeling, and comparison.
4. Open `notebooks/thailand_tourism_forecast.ipynb` in Jupyter for an interactive analysis.
